      "snippet": "### 3. Lands End and El Arco\n\nThe marketing image for Cabo, El Arco or The Arch is a rock formation in the Lands End area. If you’ve seen photos of Los Cabos, you’ve seen The Arch!\n\nVisiting El Arco is definitely not a unique thing to do in Cabo. In fact, it’s one of the most popular and touristy things to do in the area.\n\nBut I can’t leave it off the list, as it really is a naturally stunning area and no visit to Cabo would be complete without seeing it! [...] - A scenic boat cruise in a glass-bottomed boat takes you from the Marina in Cabo San Lucas out to Lands End. You’ll have time to view and photograph El Arco, as well as other rock formations like Pelican Rock where pelicans and sea lions hang out. You’ll see both beaches from the boat, and the transparent boat means you can watch the fish and marine life underwater. This will take less than an hour and you won’t get off the boat. [...] Cabo sits at the meeting point of the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Cortez, one of the most diverse marine environments in the world. Deep banks, strong currents and an abundance of fish to feed on make this one of the best places to see a number of unique shark species.\n\nBlue sharks, silky sharks, mako sharks and hammerhead sharks are the most commonly sighted in the area. These species are quite rare and not commonly found in many diving locations.\n\nAnd you can swim with them!"

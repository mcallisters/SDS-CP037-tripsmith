# Week 2 Report

## Summary of Work Done

During Week 2, significant progress was made in developing the core agents responsible for planning and managing trip itineraries:

- **PlannerAgent**: Implemented the central coordination logic to interact with other agents (FlightAgent, HotelAgent, POIAgent) and consolidate their responses into a coherent itinerary.
- **FlightAgent**: Developed functionality to search and select flights based on user preferences and constraints, including departure and arrival times, airlines, and price ranges.
- **HotelAgent**: Created methods to find suitable accommodations matching the travel dates, location, and user requirements such as star rating and amenities.
- **POIAgent**: Added support for identifying points of interest (POIs) in the destination city, considering user interests and available time slots.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Agent Modularity**: Each agent was designed to handle a specific domain (flights, hotels, POIs) to promote separation of concerns and easier maintenance.
- **Data Standardization**: Defined a common JSON schema for agent responses to ensure smooth integration by the PlannerAgent.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Enabled agents to operate asynchronously to improve performance when querying multiple data sources.
- **User Preference Handling**: Incorporated flexible filters and preferences at each agent level to tailor the itinerary closely to user needs.

## Example JSON Output

Below is an example of a sample itinerary generated by the PlannerAgent after aggregating data from the FlightAgent, HotelAgent, and POIAgent:

```json
{
  "itinerary": {
    "flights": [
      {
        "flightNumber": "AA123",
        "departure": "2024-07-01T08:00:00",
        "arrival": "2024-07-01T11:00:00",
        "from": "JFK",
        "to": "LAX",
        "airline": "American Airlines",
        "price": 320
      }
    ],
    "hotel": {
      "name": "Sunset Hotel",
      "checkIn": "2024-07-01",
      "checkOut": "2024-07-05",
      "address": "123 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles, CA",
      "stars": 4,
      "pricePerNight": 150
    },
    "pointsOfInterest": [
      {
        "name": "Griffith Observatory",
        "visitDate": "2024-07-02",
        "openingHours": "10:00-22:00",
        "description": "A popular observatory with city views and exhibits."
      },
      {
        "name": "The Getty Center",
        "visitDate": "2024-07-03",
        "openingHours": "10:00-17:30",
        "description": "Art museum with gardens and architecture."
      }
    ]
  },
  "reasoning": "Selected flight AA123 for the best balance of price and departure time. The Sunset Hotel was chosen for its proximity to POIs and high user ratings. POIs were selected based on user interests in culture and scenic views, with visits scheduled on days with optimal opening hours."
}
```

## Closing Note

Week 2 is now complete with foundational agent components implemented and integrated to produce a sample itinerary. Next steps include enhancing agent data sources, refining user preference handling, and expanding itinerary complexity.
